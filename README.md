# SlideShow

It's been about 5 years since I wrote this.
I have not used the app in a long time.

This is either a c# or visual basic program (I think c#) that will look in a folder for
a lot of files that ends in *.jpg   The program will read the jpg and display it on the screen for about 5 seconds
